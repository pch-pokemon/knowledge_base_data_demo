Since then, other γ\' strengthened Co-base alloys, such as Co-Ti-Cr-base [4], Co-Al-Mo-base [5-7] and Co-Al-V-base alloys [8], have been also developed by different research groups.""}']","Co–Ni-base superalloys benefit from γ' phase strengthening, which is critical for their overall mechanical properties, as indicated by nanoindentation studies. In contrast, conventional Co-base superalloys lack a stable γ' strengthening phase, limiting their high-temperature applications despite having higher melting temperatures, better fatigue resistance, and weldability compared to Ni-base superalloys. The development of γ' precipitation in Co-Al-W alloys and other γ' strengthened Co-base alloys has opened new paths for enhancing their performance.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer
