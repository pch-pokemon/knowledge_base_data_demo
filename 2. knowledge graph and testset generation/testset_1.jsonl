{"question":"how long-term aging affect alloys microstructure?","answer":"The microstructural stabilities of Co–30Ni-xAl-(15-x)W–1Ta–4Ti-yCr alloys were studied at 1000 °C and 1100 °C after long-term aging. Increasing Cr content reduces microstructural stability and promotes μ phase precipitation, while increasing Al\/W ratio increases γ' volume fraction and γ\/γ' lattice misfit. Cr content increases γ' phase hardness, but increasing Al\/W ratio has the opposite effect. These changes are due to elemental partitioning behaviors between γ and γ' phases."}
{"question":"How do the changes in elemental partitioning behaviors and the increase in Cr content and Al\/W ratio impact the properties of Co–Ni-base superalloys, and what implications does this have for their industrial applications?","answer":"The APT results indicate that the effects on Co–Ni-base superalloys are primarily due to changes in elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases. Increasing the Cr content and Al\/W ratio significantly enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, making it comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys like Waspaloy and Udimet 720. Additionally, a well-balanced microstructural stability, alloy density, γ' phase hardness, and oxidation resistance can be achieved. This research supports ongoing efforts to develop multi-component Co–Ni-base superalloys for various industrial applications."}
{"question":"how Ni-base superalloys diff from Co-base superalloys?","answer":"Conventional carbide and solid solution strengthened Co-base superalloys have higher melting temperature (by 50-100°C), better fatigue resistance and weldability than Ni-base superalloys. However, due to the absence of a stable γ' strengthening phase, the application of Co-base superalloys at high temperature is more limited than that of γ' strengthened Ni-base superalloys."}
{"question":"how do Co-Al-V-base alloys compare in terms of creep properties and oxidation resistance to commercial Ni-base single crystal superalloys?","answer":"Co-Al-V-base alloys have been developed alongside other γ' strengthened Co-base alloys like Co-Ti-Cr-base and Co-Al-Mo-base. It has been confirmed that the creep properties of Co-Al-W-base single crystal alloys can be comparable to that of commercial Ni-base single crystal superalloys. However, the oxidation resistance at high temperatures is also crucial for their engineering applications, with most studies focusing on oxidation behavior at 800°C and 900°C, and limited data available for 1000°C."}
{"question":"How does the addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system influence the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer and the overall oxide scale structure?","answer":"The addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system significantly enlarges the γ\/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing the solubility of Al in these phases. This is necessary for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, which forms only when the Al concentration exceeds a critical value. The continuous Al₂O₃ layer provides better oxidation resistance. Additionally, the overall oxide scale structure includes an intermediate (Co, Ni)₂(Ti, Al)O₄ spinel type oxide layer and an inner Cr₂O₃ layer, which is porous and less effective at high temperatures. The internal oxides, enriched with O and Al, further indicate the presence of Al₂O₃ or TiO₂, contributing to the alloy's microstructural characteristics."}
{"question":"How does the synergistic effect of Al and Cr influence the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance in the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system, particularly when considering the role of 30 at.% Ni?","answer":"The synergistic effect of Al and Cr in the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system significantly enhances the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, as Cr provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration needed. This is illustrated in Fig. 11, which shows the oxide map at 1000 °C. Additionally, the presence of 30 at.% Ni is crucial as it enlarges the γ\/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing Al solubility and thereby contributing to both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This dual benefit ensures that the alloy maintains its protective oxide layer and structural integrity under high-temperature conditions."}
{"question":"How do the oxidation resistances of alloy 5Cr-B and alloy 9Cr-A compare to Cr-free Co-Al-W ternary alloys and how does the two-phase microstructure affect the mole fraction calculation in these alloys?","answer":"The oxidation resistances of alloy 5Cr-B and alloy 9Cr-A are much better than those reported for Cr-free Co-Al-W ternary alloys and are comparable with commercial Ni-base superalloys Waspaloy and Udimet 720 under the same oxidation conditions. However, further improvement is needed compared to 1st and 2nd generation single crystal superalloys CMXS-6 and CMSX-4. In alloy systems with a two-phase microstructure, the mole fraction of the γ' phase can be estimated using the lever rule based on the mass balance equation, which involves calculating the slope of a line from the elemental concentrations in each phase and the nominal alloy composition. This method is illustrated for alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 5Cr-B, but data for alloy 9Cr-A was not considered due to the precipitation of the μ phase."}
{"question":"How do the microstructure changes at high temperatures affect the isothermal oxidation of alloys?","answer":"The microstructure changes at high temperatures, such as the coarsening of γ' precipitates in samples aged at 1000 °C for 1000 h, enable separate indentation on single precipitates, which is crucial for understanding the material's behavior. These changes are significant for isothermal oxidation, as seen in the SEM-BSE images of oxide scales in alloys after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for 100 h. Additionally, the careful optimization of Cr addition to Co–Al–W-base alloys is essential to maintain high temperature capability, which is directly related to their performance during isothermal oxidation."}
{"question":"How does the variation in nickel content and the presence of alloy 9Cr-A impact the $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Ta}$ value in high-performance alloys?","answer":"The variation in nickel content, where all considered alloys contain 30 at.% Ni except the last one which has slightly higher Ni, does not directly impact the $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Ta}$ value as per the data reported. However, alloy 9Cr-A was not considered in the analysis due to the precipitation of the μ phase. The present results indicate that increasing the Cr content, which is a component of alloy 9Cr-A, results in an increase of the $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Ta}$ value. This suggests that the Cr content has a more significant effect on $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Ta}$ than the nickel content, although further experimental data is needed to confirm these effects comprehensively."}
{"question":"How do the variations in Cr and Al concentrations in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys affect their microstructural stability and high temperature capability, as evidenced by experimental studies and oxide layer formation?","answer":"The variations in Cr and Al concentrations in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys significantly impact their microstructural stability and high temperature capability. Experimental studies, as shown in Fig. 11, demonstrate the ability of these alloys to form a continuous Al₂O₃ layer after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C, which is crucial for their high temperature performance. The microstructural stability was investigated at 1000 °C and 1100 °C, revealing that increasing Cr content reduces microstructural stability and promotes μ phase precipitation, while increasing the Al\/W ratio enhances the γ' volume fraction and γ\/γ' lattice misfit. Additionally, increasing Cr content increases the hardness of the γ' phase, whereas increasing the Al\/W ratio has the opposite effect. These changes are attributed to the elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases. Furthermore, the addition of ~30 at.% Ni is used to improve microstructural stability, although Cr addition decreases the γ' solvus temperature, which is essential for high temperature capability. Therefore, the addition of Cr must be carefully optimized to balance these properties."}
{"question":"How does the addition of Cr influence the formation of Al₂O₃ layers and the microstructural stability of Co–Al–W-base alloys, particularly in relation to γ' precipitates?","answer":"The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al, accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers by providing nucleation sites through transient Cr₂O₃, thereby reducing the critical Al concentration for continuous Al₂O₃ layer formation. However, increasing Cr content reduces the γ' volume fraction and the γ' solvus temperature, which negatively impacts the thermodynamic stability of the γ' phase. To counteract this and improve microstructural stability, ~30 at.% Ni is added to Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys, as Ni enlarges the γ\/γ' two-phase region, essential for high-temperature capability. Thus, the addition of Cr must be carefully optimized to balance these effects."}
{"question":"How do temperature effects and alloy composition influence the performance and suitability of 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B superalloys for engineering applications, particularly in terms of creep resistance and oxidation properties?","answer":"At 1100 °C, the δ of alloy 5Cr-B distinctly reduced to ~0 due to the spherical γ' morphology, indicating a potential decrease in creep resistance. In contrast, alloy 5Cr-A exhibited a higher δ at the same temperature, suggesting better creep resistance despite similar γ' volume fractions. However, alloy 5Cr-B, with a high Al\/W ratio, showed higher oxidation resistance and lower density, making it more suitable for engineering applications around 1000 °C. The elemental partitioning behavior, particularly the distribution of Cr which predominantly partitions to the γ phase, also plays a crucial role in determining the lattice parameters, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical behavior of these alloys. Long-term aging studies, such as those conducted for 1000 h, are essential to understand these properties in multiple-component alloy systems, as they provide insights closer to equilibrium conditions."}
{"question":"How do the microstructural characteristics and oxide scale thickness of alloy 5Cr-B compare to those of alloys 5Cr-A and 9Cr-A, and what factors might contribute to the observed differences?","answer":"Alloy 5Cr-B exhibits a distinctly thinner oxide scale of approximately 5.3 μm in thickness compared to alloys 5Cr-A and 9Cr-A. The microstructural characteristics of alloy 5Cr-B include a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer with a thickness of 1.3 μm adjacent to the alloy matrix, and its oxide scale generally consists of four layers: (Co, Ni)O, (Co, Ni)₂(Ti, Al)O₄, Cr₂O₃, and Al₂O₃, from the outside to the inside. In contrast, alloy 9Cr-A was not considered in the data due to the precipitation of the μ phase. The differences in oxide scale thickness and microstructure can be attributed to variations in Cr concentration and Al\/W ratio, as well as the specific processing methods used, such as arc melting under argon atmosphere and solution heat treatment at 1250 °C for 24 h followed by air cooling."}
{"question":"How does the addition of Chromium affect the formation of Al₂O₃ layers in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys?","answer":"The addition of Chromium has a remarkable synergistic effect with Aluminum for accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys. This is because the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, thereby reducing the critical Al concentration value required for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This synergistic effect is illustrated in an oxide map of the alloy system at 1000 °C, which shows the interaction between Al and Cr in promoting the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer."}
{"question":"How does the variation in Ni concentration influence the critical Al content in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys, and what is the significance of this relationship for compositional optimization?","answer":"The variation in Ni concentration influences the critical Al content in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys by increasing the interdiffusion coefficients of alloying elements in an otherwise Co-rich matrix. This effect necessitates further exploration to understand its impact on the critical Al concentration. The significance of this relationship lies in its role in compositional optimization, as the critical Al content is also affected by Cr concentration, and increasing Cr content reduces the critical Al concentration. This interplay is crucial for achieving continuous Al₂O₃ formation, particularly at high temperatures, and requires more experimental data for definitive results."}
{"question":"How do the elemental partitioning behaviors of Cr and Al\/W ratio influence the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance in Co-base superalloys?","answer":"The elemental partitioning behaviors of Cr and Al\/W ratio are crucial for evaluating the microstructural stability, oxidation resistance, and hardness of the γ' phase in newly designed Co-base superalloys. These characteristic parameters are directly associated with how elements are distributed within the alloy, which in turn affects their overall performance and durability."}
{"question":"How do the Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys compare to those in Co–Ni-base superalloys, and what implications does this have for their mechanical properties and oxidation resistance?","answer":"In Ni-base superalloys, the Al and Cr contents are highly optimized, as seen in the widely used 2nd Ni-base single crystal superalloy CMSX-4, which contains 5.6 wt% Al and 6.5 wt% Cr. These optimized levels contribute to improved oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. In contrast, Co–Ni-base superalloys, such as Co–Al–W-base alloys, typically contain less than 4 wt% Al and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases, indicating a need for further optimization to achieve similar oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. Additionally, nanoindentation on the γ' phase of experimental Co–Ni-base superalloys shows that γ' phase strengthening is critical for their overall mechanical properties, highlighting the importance of balanced alloy design."}
{"question":"How does the addition of Cr in Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys influence the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at 1000°C, and what are the implications for the design of these alloys compared to Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys?","answer":"The addition of Cr in Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys influences the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at 1000°C by affecting the partitioning coefficients ($K_{γ'\/γ}$) of essential γ' forming elements like Al and W. As shown in Table 6, alloys with varying Cr content exhibit different abilities to form a continuous Al₂O₃ layer; for instance, '5Cr-B' (with 5% Cr) can form the layer, while 'FC-0.0' (with 0% Cr) cannot. The discussion indicates that Cr increases $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Al}$ and $K_{γ'\/γ}^{Ti}$ but decreases $K_{γ'\/γ}^W$. These differences must be considered in the design of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys, as Al and W are crucial for γ' formation. Compared to Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys, the elemental partitioning behaviors of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys are more similar to Ni-base superalloys, highlighting the need for further experimental confirmation of Cr's effects on other elements."}
{"question":"What are the typical oxide scales and distribution of alloying elements in the 5Cr-A, 9Cr-A, and 5Cr-B alloys after specific thermal treatments?","answer":"The typical oxide scales in the alloys 5Cr-A, 9Cr-A, and 5Cr-B after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for 100 h in air are shown in SEM-BSE images, along with their XRD results (Fig. 7). Additionally, the APT reconstructions of these alloys after water quenching for samples aged at 1000 °C for 1000 h reveal the distribution of alloying elements in the γ and γ' phases, as well as the partitioning coefficients between the γ' and γ phases (Fig. 4)."}
{"question":"How do the formation energies of different elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys influence their partitioning to the γ' phase, and what experimental data is available on the formation of continuous Al₂O₃ layers in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys with varying Cr and Al concentrations?","answer":"The formation energies of different elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influence their partitioning to the γ' phase. According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., the formation energies of Co₃Al, Co₃W, Co₃Ti, Co₃Ta, Co₃Ni, and Co₃Cr with L1₂ structure are -17.97, -4.81, -25.88, -23.44, 0.50, and 2.36 kJ\/mol, respectively. This suggests that Al, W, Ti, and Ta are expected to partition to the γ' phase, whereas Ni and Cr are not. However, this is an idealistic analysis and may vary in different cases. Regarding Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys, experimental data from literature and studies show the ability to form continuous Al₂O₃ layers after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C in air. For instance, an alloy with 10 at.% Cr and 9.5 at.% Al demonstrated the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, as depicted in Fig. 11. This data highlights the impact of varying Cr and Al concentrations on the oxidation behavior of these alloys."}
{"question":"How do the formation energies of various elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys influence their partitioning to the γ' phase, and what implications does this have for optimizing Al and Cr contents in these alloys for improved oxidation resistance and microstructural stability?","answer":"The formation energies of elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influence their partitioning to the γ' phase. According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., elements like Al, W, Ti, and Ta, which have negative formation energies (-17.97, -4.81, -25.88, and -23.44 kJ\/mol respectively), are expected to partition to the γ' phase. In contrast, Ni and Cr, with positive or near-zero formation energies (0.50 and 2.36 kJ\/mol respectively), do not favor this partitioning. This partitioning behavior suggests that Al and Cr contents in Co–Al–W-base alloys need to be carefully optimized. While Al can improve oxidation resistance by forming a passive layer and has synergistic effects with Cr, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases. Therefore, further optimization of Al and Cr contents is necessary to enhance both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability in these alloys."}
{"question":"How does the addition of 30 at.% Ni influence the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance in Co-Ni-base alloys, and what are the implications for alloy design?","answer":"The addition of 30 at.% Ni in Co-Ni-base alloys enlarges the γ\/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing the solubility of Al in these phases. This is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. The external oxide scales of these alloys consist of CoO, Co₂TiO₄, and Cr₂O₃ layers, while internal Al₂O₃ forms in alloys with low Al content (9 at.%). High Al content (11 at.%) suppresses internal oxidation, forming a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This understanding is beneficial for designing Co-Ni-base multiple-component alloys that balance microstructural stability, oxidation properties, mechanical properties, and lower density, and aids in understanding partitioning behavior after long-term aging and oxidation mechanisms at elevated temperatures, such as 1000 °C."}
{"question":"How do the mechanical properties of Co–Ni-base superalloys compare to those of Co-base superalloys, particularly in terms of γ' phase strengthening?","answer":"Co–Ni-base superalloys benefit from γ' phase strengthening, which is critical for their overall mechanical properties, as indicated by nanoindentation studies. In contrast, conventional Co-base superalloys lack a stable γ' strengthening phase, limiting their high-temperature applications despite having higher melting temperatures, better fatigue resistance, and weldability compared to Ni-base superalloys. The development of γ' precipitation in Co-Al-W alloys and other γ' strengthened Co-base alloys has opened new paths for enhancing their performance."}
{"question":"How do the mass gain curves of experimental Co–Ni-base superalloys compare to those of commercial Ni-base superalloys after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C, as discussed in the study on the effects of Cr and Al\/W ratio?","answer":"The mass gain curves of experimental Co–Ni-base superalloys, such as 5Cr-A, 9Cr-A, and 5Cr-B, show varying mass gains after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for 100 hours. For instance, 5Cr-A had a mass gain of 7.06 mg\/cm², 9Cr-A had 2.01 mg\/cm², and 5Cr-B had 0.99 mg\/cm². These values are compared with other Co–Al–W-base alloys and commercial Ni-base superalloys, as depicted in Fig. 6 of the study titled 'Effects of Cr and Al\/W ratio on the microstructural stability, oxidation property and γ' phase nano-hardness of multi-component Co–Ni-base superalloys'. The comparison highlights the performance differences in oxidation resistance among these alloy types."}
