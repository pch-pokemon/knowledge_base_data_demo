1. **Microstructural Stability**: Increasing the Cr content in alloys can significantly reduce the microstructural stability and promote the precipitation of μ phase. This indicates that the presence of Cr can lead to changes in the alloy's microstructure over time.

2. **Phase Formation**: The higher Cr content in alloy 9Cr-A resulted in the precipitation of μ phase, which was identified by XRD and EPMA. This phase was not present in the 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B alloys, suggesting that the Cr content plays a role in phase formation.

1. **Elemental Partitioning Behaviors:**
   - The APT (Atom Probe Tomography) results indicate that elements like Ni, Al, Ta, and Ti tend to partition to the γ' phase, while Co and Cr have a preference for the γ phase. This partitioning affects the microstructure and properties of the alloy.
   - The order of elemental partitioning coefficients shows that Ta has the highest affinity for the γ' phase, followed by Ti, Al, Ni, and W, with Co and Cr having lower affinities. This order influences the distribution of elements within the alloy.

2. **Increase in Cr Content:**
   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase.
   - It increases the hardness of the γ' phase, which is beneficial for enhancing the alloy's mechanical properties.
   - However, it also reduces the microstructural stability, which could potentially affect the alloy's performance under certain conditions.

3. **Increase in Al/W Ratio:**
   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction, which can improve the alloy's oxidation resistance.
   - It also increases the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can affect the alloy's mechanical behavior.
   - The increase in Al/W ratio can soften the γ' phase, which might have implications for the alloy's hardness and strength.

**Implications for Industrial Applications:**

- The well-balanced combination of microstructural stability, alloy density, γ' phase hardness, and oxidation resistance achieved through these modifications can lead to the development of high-performance Co–Ni-base superalloys.
- The improved oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys like Waspaloy and Udimet 720, suggests that these alloys could be suitable for applications where resistance to high-temperature oxidation is critical.

3. **γ' Strengthening Phase**: Ni-base superalloys often contain a stable γ' strengthening phase, which is not present in Co-base superalloys. The absence of a stable γ' phase in Co-base superalloys limits their application at high temperatures compared to γ' strengthened Ni-base superalloys.

4. **Development and Research**: Co-Al-W alloys with γ' precipitation were first identified in 1971 and have been systematically studied since 2006, opening up a new path for the development of Co-base superalloys. In contrast, Ni-base superalloys have been more extensively researched and developed.

5. **Elemental Partitioning**: The elemental partitioning behaviors of Co-Ni-base alloys are closer to those of Ni-base superalloys compared to Co-Al-W-base alloys.

6. **Oxidation Resistance**: While the creep properties of Co-Al-W-base single crystal alloys can be comparable to those of commercial Ni-base single crystal superalloys, the oxidation resistance at high temperatures is also essential for engineering applications, and this is an area where Ni-base superalloys have traditionally been more studied.

7. **Application Focus**: Ni-base superalloys are often used in high-temperature applications due to their γ' strengthening phase, while Co-base superalloys are used in applications where higher melting temperatures and better fatigue resistance are required.

These differences reflect the unique properties and applications of each type of superalloy.","Conventional carbide and solid solution strengthened Co-base superalloys have higher melting temperature (by 50-100°C), better fatigue resistance and weldability than Ni-base superalloys. However, due to the absence of a stable γ' strengthening phase, the application of Co-base superalloys at high temperature is more limited than that of γ' strengthened Ni-base superalloys.",0.8461538461538461,0.9123816377438168,1.0,0.99999999998

1. **Formation of Continuous Al₂O₃ Layer**: The study indicates that a continuous Al₂O₃ layer forms only when the Al concentration is higher than a critical value in the Ni–Cr–Al or Co–Cr–Al alloy systems. The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is because the presence of Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, which in turn increases the solubility of Al in the γ/γ' two-phase region. This enhanced solubility of Al is crucial for the formation of the protective oxide layer.

2. **Synergistic Effect with Cr**: The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. The transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, even lower concentrations of Al can lead to the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer.

3. **Oxide Scale Structure**: The presence of 30 at.% Ni contributes to the overall structure of the oxide scale. It helps in maintaining the microstructural stability, which is essential for the integrity of the oxide scale. The combination of Ni and Cr in the alloy system is optimized to promote the formation of a protective oxide layer that is continuous and stable, thus enhancing the alloy's resistance to oxidation.

In summary, the addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system is crucial for achieving a continuous Al₂O₃ layer by increasing Al solubility and enhancing the synergistic effect with Cr, which together contribute to the microstructural stability and overall oxide scale structure.","The addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing the solubility of Al in these phases. This is necessary for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, which forms only when the Al concentration exceeds a critical value. The continuous Al₂O₃ layer provides better oxidation resistance. Additionally, the overall oxide scale structure includes an intermediate (Co, Ni)₂(Ti, Al)O₄ spinel type oxide layer and an inner Cr₂O₃ layer, which is porous and less effective at high temperatures.

1. **Oxidation Resistance**: Al and Cr can both contribute to the formation of protective oxide layers. Al forms a passive layer that improves oxidation resistance, and it typically has synergistic effects with Cr in the formation of protective oxidation layers. This is because the presence of Al can enhance the stability and growth of the Al₂O₃ layer, which is beneficial for oxidation resistance.

2. **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of Cr to Co–Al–W-base alloys improves oxidation resistance by promoting the formation of a protective oxide layer, Cr₂O₃. However, the γ/γ' two-phase region of Co–Al–W-base alloys is very narrow, and adding Cr can promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to mechanical properties.

3. **Role of 30 at.% Ni**: The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. Ni has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region, which helps to mitigate the precipitation of brittle secondary phases that Cr can promote. This is particularly important in the Co–Al–W-base alloy system, where the γ/γ' two-phase region is narrow.

4. **Optimization of Al and Cr Contents**: The contents of Al and Cr in Co–Al–W-base alloys need to be optimized for both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. The synergistic effects of Al and Cr have been rarely considered and discussed in previous studies, but they are important for achieving the desired properties.

In summary, the synergistic effect of Al and Cr in the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system is beneficial for both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. The addition of 30 at.% Ni is crucial for optimizing these effects, as it helps to stabilize the microstructure and expand the γ/γ' two-phase region, which is essential for the alloy's performance at high temperatures.","The synergistic effect of Al and Cr in the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system significantly enhances the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, as Cr provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration needed.

Additionally, the presence of 30 at.% Ni is crucial as it enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing Al solubility and thereby contributing to both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance.

1. **Oxide Formation**: The context discusses the formation of protective scales on metals, such as Cr₂O₃, Al₂O₃, and SiO₂, which are formed by elements like Cr, Al, and Si. These protective layers are a result of oxidation processes and can be influenced by the microstructure of the alloy.

2. **Stability of Oxide Layers**: The stability of these oxide layers at high temperatures is crucial. For instance, Cr₂O₃ is not stable above 900 °C and is further oxidized to gaseous CrO₃. This suggests that the microstructure, particularly the presence and stability of these oxides, can change with temperature and affect oxidation resistance.

3. **Synergistic Effects**: The context mentions that elements like Cr, Al, and Si have synergistic effects on each other, which can influence the microstructure and, consequently, the oxidation resistance of the alloy.

4. **Embrittlement**: The addition of Si can embrittle alloys, which would affect the microstructure and potentially the alloy's ability to resist oxidation.

5. **Cr Content and Al/W Ratio**: Increasing the Cr content or the Al/W ratio can enhance oxidation resistance, as seen in the case of alloy 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B. This suggests that the microstructure, which is influenced by the concentration of these elements, plays a role in oxidation resistance.

6. **Oxide Layer Growth**: The growth rate of external oxides, such as CoO, can be affected by the microstructure, as indicated by the beneficial effect of Cr for the nucleation and growth of Cr₂O₃ layers.

1. **Microstructural Stability**:
   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability of the alloys. This is because higher Cr content promotes the precipitation of μ phase, which can lead to a less stable microstructure.
   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can also affect the microstructural stability. The γ' phase is a strengthening phase in superalloys, but changes in its volume fraction and lattice misfit can impact the overall stability.

2. **High Temperature Capability**:
   - The addition of Cr decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys. This is a concern for the high temperature capability of superalloys, as a lower solvus temperature can limit their ability to maintain structural integrity at elevated temperatures.
   - The balance between Cr and Al content is crucial for maintaining the high temperature capability. While increasing Cr content can enhance oxidation resistance, it can also negatively impact the high temperature performance due to the decrease in γ' solvus temperature.

3. **Oxide Layer Formation**:
   - The experimental results indicate that increasing both the Cr content and the Al/W ratio predominantly enhance the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C. This suggests that the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the alloy is improved with these changes, which is beneficial for maintaining high temperature capability and structural integrity.

1. Formation of Al₂O₃ Layers:
   - The addition of Cr has a remarkable synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers. This is because the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, which reduces the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer [28].
   - This synergistic effect is illustrated in Fig. 11, which plots an oxide map of the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system at 1000 °C, showing the ability for forming continuous Al₂O₃ layers of different alloys.

2. Microstructural Stability:
   - The addition of Cr promotes significant precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are deleterious for mechanical properties [21,22].
   - To alleviate this problem, most Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys utilize ~30 at.% Ni additions to improve their microstructural stability [14,17,23–26]. The Ni addition is effective because it has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region [27].

   - The addition of Cr also decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys, which is essential for the high-temperature capability of superalloys [content].

In summary, while Cr enhances the formation of Al₂O₃ layers through its synergistic effect with Al, it also destabilizes the microstructure, particularly by promoting the precipitation of brittle secondary phases and reducing the γ' solvus temperature. This necessitates careful optimization of Cr content, often in conjunction with Ni additions, to balance oxidation resistance and microstructural stability.","The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al, accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers by providing nucleation sites through transient Cr₂O₃, thereby reducing the critical Al concentration for continuous Al₂O₃ layer formation.

**Temperature Effects:**

1. **Creep Resistance:** At higher temperatures, such as 1100 °C, the δ phase in alloy 5Cr-B distinctly reduces, which is deduced by the spherical γ' morphology. This reduction in δ phase may affect the coherent strengthening effect of the γ' phase, which is predominantly associated with the magnitude of δ. Despite this, alloy 5Cr-A may exhibit better creep resistance than alloy 5Cr-B at 1100 °C due to a higher magnitude of δ, assuming their γ' volume fractions are similar.

2. **Oxidation Properties:** At 1000 °C, the oxidation resistance of alloys can be influenced by the formation of protective oxide layers. The Cr content in the alloys plays a role in the nucleation and growth of Cr₂O₃ layers, which can reduce the growth rate of external oxides like CoO. However, above 900 °C, Cr₂O₃ layers can become porous, which may not provide adequate oxidation protection.

**Alloy Composition:**

1. **Creep Resistance:** The Al/W ratio in alloy 5Cr-B is higher than in alloy 5Cr-A, which increases the γ' volume fraction. A higher γ' volume fraction is appreciated for better mechanical properties, such as creep resistance. Both alloys show promise for good creep resistance at high temperatures, with γ' volume fractions above 80% after aging at 1000 °C for 1000 h.

2. **Oxidation Properties:** The higher Al concentration in alloy 5Cr-B allows for the formation of a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer, which provides effective oxidation protection even at 1000 °C. This results in superior oxidation resistance for alloy 5Cr-B compared to alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 9Cr-A, which exhibit inferior oxidation resistance due to the formation of discrete internal oxide Al₂O₃ and porous Cr₂O₃ layers.

**Suitability for Engineering Applications:**

- **Alloy 5Cr-B:** Due to its higher oxidation resistance and the potential for better creep resistance at high temperatures, alloy 5Cr-B may be more suitable for engineering applications over alloy 5Cr-A at around 1000 °C.
- **Alloy 5Cr-A:** While it may have better creep resistance at 1100 °C, its inferior oxidation properties compared to alloy 5Cr-B may limit its suitability for certain high-temperature engineering applications.

In summary, the temperature and composition of the alloys affect their creep resistance and oxidation properties, with alloy 5Cr-B generally showing better performance in terms of oxidation resistance, which is crucial for high-temperature engineering applications.","At 1100 °C, the δ of alloy 5Cr-B distinctly reduced to ~0 due to the spherical γ' morphology, indicating a potential decrease in creep resistance. In contrast, alloy 5Cr-A exhibited a higher δ at the same temperature, suggesting better creep resistance despite similar γ' volume fractions. However, alloy 5Cr-B, with a high Al/W ratio, showed higher oxidation resistance and lower density, making it more suitable for engineering applications around 1000 °C. The elemental partitioning behavior, particularly the distribution of Cr which predominantly partitions to the γ phase, also plays a crucial role in determining the lattice parameters, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical behavior of these alloys. Long-term aging studies, such as those conducted for 1000 h, are essential to understand these properties in multiple-component alloy systems, as they provide insights closer to equilibrium conditions.",1.0,0.9406588531057561,0.6,0.9999999999875

- **Thermal Aging:** The aging process at different temperatures can alter the microstructure and, consequently, the oxide scale characteristics of the alloys.

1. **Mechanical Properties**: The optimized Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys contribute to their superior mechanical properties. The synergistic effects of Al and Cr in forming protective oxidation layers can enhance the oxidation resistance and contribute to the overall strength and stability of the alloy.

2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The higher Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys, such as CMSX-4, are likely to provide better oxidation resistance due to the formation of a passive layer that protects the metal from further oxidation. This is important for applications where the alloy is exposed to high-temperature environments.

In Co–Ni-base superalloys, the lower Al and Cr contents are chosen to avoid deleterious phases and to optimize the microstructure for oxidation resistance and microstructural stability.

The presence of Cr enhances the synergistic effect with Al, which accelerates the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. Specifically, the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, thereby reducing the critical Al concentration value required for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, less Al is needed to achieve a continuous oxide layer, which is beneficial for the alloy design.

The implications for the design of these alloys compared to Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys are as follows:

1. **Reduced Al Content**: The lower critical Al concentration for forming a continuous Al₂O₃ layer allows for the possibility of using less Al in the alloy composition, which can be advantageous for cost reduction and material efficiency.

2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The improved formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer enhances the oxidation resistance of the alloy at high temperatures, which is crucial for applications where thermal stability is required.

3. **Microstructural Stability**: However, the addition of Cr can also promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which can be detrimental to the mechanical properties of the alloy. This is a trade-off that needs to be considered in the alloy design.

4. **γ/γ' Two-Phase Region**: The addition of Cr can affect the γ/γ' two-phase region of the alloy, potentially altering the microstructure and properties. The effects on the γ/γ' two-phase region need to be carefully managed to maintain the desired microstructural stability.

5. **Elemental Partitioning**: The elemental partitioning behaviors of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys may be closer to those of Ni-base superalloys, which could influence the alloy's performance and processing.

In summary, while the addition of Cr improves the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer and enhances oxidation resistance, it also introduces complexities in terms of microstructural stability and the γ/γ' two-phase region. These factors must be carefully considered during the design of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys to optimize their performance.","The addition of Cr in Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys influences the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at 1000°C by affecting the partitioning coefficients ($K_{γ'/γ}$) of essential γ' forming elements like Al and W. As shown in Table 6, alloys with varying Cr content exhibit different abilities to form a continuous Al₂O₃ layer; for instance, '5Cr-B' (with 5% Cr) can form the layer, while 'FC-0.0' (with 0% Cr) cannot. The discussion indicates that Cr increases $K_{γ'/γ}^{Al}$ and $K_{γ'/γ}^{Ti}$ but decreases $K_{γ'/γ}^W$. These differences must be considered in the design of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys, as Al and W are crucial for γ' formation.

The first-principles study by Omori at el [35]. shows that the formation energies of Co₃Al, Co₃W, Co₃Ti, Co₃Ta, Co₃Ni and Co₃Cr with L1₂ structure are -17.97, -4.81, -25.88, -23.44, 0.50 and 2.36 kJ/mol, respectively, suggesting that Al, W, Ti and Ta are expected to partition to the γ\' phase in Co–Al–W-base alloys, in contrast to Ni and Cr. However, this is just an idealistic analysis, which could be moderately different for various cases.""}']","The formation energies of various elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys influence their partitioning to the γ' phase in the following way:

1. **Formation Energy**: The magnitude of $K_{γ'/γ}^X$ in Co–Al–W-base alloys is determined by the formation energy of the L1₂ structured Co₃X phase. The more negative the formation energy, the larger the magnitude of $K_{γ'/γ}^X$.

2. **Element Partitioning**: According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., the formation energies of various Co₃X phases with L1₂ structure are as follows:
   - Co₃Al: -17.97 kJ/mol
   - Co₃W: -4.81 kJ/mol
   - Co₃Ti: -25.88 kJ/mol
   - Co₃Ta: -23.44 kJ/mol
   - Co₃Ni: 0.50 kJ/mol
   - Co₃Cr: 2.36 kJ/mol

   This suggests that Al, W, Ti, and Ta are expected to partition to the γ' phase in Co–Al–W-base alloys, as they have more negative formation energies compared to Ni and Cr. In contrast, Ni and Cr are less likely to partition to the γ' phase.

3. **Implications for Optimization**:
   - **Oxidation Resistance**: Since Al and Cr are less likely to partition to the γ' phase, optimizing their contents in the alloy can be challenging. However, their presence is crucial for oxidation resistance. Al forms a passive layer that improves oxidation resistance, and Cr promotes the formation of a protective oxide layer (Cr₂O₃).
   - **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of Cr improves oxidation resistance but can promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to mechanical properties. To mitigate this, alloys often include Ni additions to expand the γ/γ' two-phase region and improve microstructural stability.
   - **Al and Cr Contents**: To optimize the Al and Cr contents for improved oxidation resistance without significantly reducing microstructural stability, it is important to balance their concentrations. This may involve finding the right amount of Al and Cr that can form protective layers while also considering the effects of other elements like Ni, which can stabilize the microstructure.

In summary, the formation energies of elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys play a critical role in determining their partitioning to the γ' phase. This has implications for optimizing the Al and Cr contents to achieve a balance between oxidation resistance and microstructural stability.","The formation energies of elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influence their partitioning to the γ' phase. According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., elements like Al, W, Ti, and Ta, which have negative formation energies (-17.97, -4.81, -25.88, and -23.44 kJ/mol respectively), are expected to partition to the γ' phase. In contrast, Ni and Cr, with positive or near-zero formation energies (0.50 and 2.36 kJ/mol respectively), do not favor this partitioning. This partitioning behavior suggests that Al and Cr contents in Co–Al–W-base alloys need to be carefully optimized. While Al can improve oxidation resistance by forming a passive layer and has synergistic effects with Cr, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases. Therefore, further optimization of Al and Cr contents is necessary to enhance both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability in these alloys.",1.0,0.943669961018981,1.0,0.99999999998

1. **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is because Ni has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region in these alloys. The γ/γ' two-phase region refers to the region in the alloy's phase diagram where both γ (the face-centered cubic phase) and γ' (the ordered face-centered cubic phase) phases can coexist. By increasing the size of this region, Ni helps to maintain a stable microstructure, which is important for the alloy's mechanical properties and resistance to phase transformations.

2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The study by Weiser et al. indicates that Al₂O₃ starts to nucleate in the γ channel, meaning that Al atoms are exclusively provided by the γ channel during the initial stages of internal scale formation. A high concentration of Al in the γ phase (C^Al_{γ}) is crucial for the formation of an adequate Al₂O₃ layer, which is a protective oxide layer that helps to resist oxidation. Increasing the Al/W ratio in the alloys results in a higher C^Al_{γ}, which is beneficial for the nucleation and stability of Al₂O₃. The addition of 30 at.% Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, which increases the solubility of Al in the γ/γ' two-phase region, thus enhancing the formation of the protective Al₂O₃ layer.

The implications for alloy design include:

- **Optimization of Composition**: Designers should consider the addition of 30 at.% Ni to improve both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is particularly important for alloys intended for high-temperature applications where oxidation resistance is critical.
- **Balancing Properties**: Achieving a balance between microstructural stability, oxidation resistance, and other properties such as density and hardness is essential. The addition of Ni helps to achieve this balance by influencing the phase composition and the formation of protective oxide layers.
- **Enhanced Performance**: The improved oxidation resistance and microstructural stability can lead to enhanced performance of the alloy, making it suitable for applications where these properties are critical, such as in superalloys for high-temperature turbines and other aerospace components.","The addition of 30 at.% Ni in Co-Ni-base alloys enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing the solubility of Al in these phases. This is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance.

High Al content (11 at.%) suppresses internal oxidation, forming a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer.
