       "\"The addition of Cr to Co–Al–W-base alloys has a dual influence on the formation of Al₂O₃ layers and the microstructural stability of these alloys, particularly concerning γ' precipitates:\\n\\n1. **Formation of Al₂O₃ Layers:**\\n   - **Synergistic Effect with Al:** The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with aluminum (Al), which accelerates the formation of an Al₂O₃ protective layer. This is because the transient formation of Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, effectively lowering the critical Al concentration required for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This is illustrated in the oxide map (Fig. 11), where alloys with Cr and Al show the ability to form a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at certain concentrations after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C.\\n\\n2. **Microstructural Stability and γ' Precipitates:**\\n   - **Narrow γ/γ' Two-Phase Region:** The γ/γ' two-phase region in Co–Al–W-base alloys is inherently narrow. The addition of Cr promotes the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to the mechanical properties of the alloys.\\n   - **Impact on γ' Solvus Temperature:** Cr decreases the γ' solvus temperature, which is crucial for the high-temperature capabilities of superalloys. A lower γ' solvus temperature can compromise the alloy's performance at elevated temperatures.\\n   - **Ni Additions to Counteract Cr's Impact:** To mitigate the negative effects of Cr on microstructural stability, approximately 30 at.% Ni is added to these alloys. Nickel helps to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region, thereby improving microstructural stability.\\n   - **Precipitation of μ Phase:** Increasing Cr content has been shown to reduce microstructural stability and promote the precipitation of the μ phase, which is not desirable for the alloy's properties.\\n\\nIn summary, while Cr enhances oxidation resistance by aiding in the formation of a protective Al₂O₃ layer, it also poses challenges to the microstructural stability of Co–Al–W-base alloys by affecting the γ/γ' phase stability and promoting detrimental phase precipitations. The careful optimization of Cr content, along with the addition of Ni, is necessary to balance these opposing effects and achieve alloys with both good oxidation resistance and microstructural stability suitable for high-temperature applications.\""

At the same time, increasing the Cr content increases the hardness of γ\\' phase and increasing Al/W ratio shows the opposite effect. The APT results reveal that such effects should be mainly attributed to the change of elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ\\' phases. Furthermore, increasing the Cr content and Al/W ratio predominantly enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, resulting in promising oxidation property which is comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys Waspaloy and Udimet 720.

      "final answer：\n",
      "The addition of chromium (Cr) to Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influences the formation of Al₂O₃ layers and the microstructural stability of the alloys, particularly in relation to γ' precipitates. Here is a comprehensive integration of the provided sub-answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of Cr accelerates the formation of Al₂O₃ layers in Co–Al–W-base alloys by synergistically interacting with aluminum (Al). This synergy leads to the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, which is crucial for enhancing the oxidation resistance of the alloys. The transient formation of Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration needed for layer formation. This results in improved oxidation resistance, as evidenced by the lower mass gain observed in alloys with Cr after isothermal oxidation (source: D:/knowledge_base/Data/1.json).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the addition of Cr also has a negative impact on the microstructural stability of the alloys. Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability, which can be detrimental to the mechanical properties. This reduction in stability is due to the promotion of the μ phase precipitation, which is harmful to the alloy's mechanical properties. Additionally, the inclusion of Cr decreases the γ' solvus temperature, which is essential for the high-temperature capability of superalloys (source: D:/knowledge_base/Data/1.json).\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of γ' precipitates, Cr affects their formation in several ways. It reduces the microstructural stability, which can affect the γ' precipitate formation and stability. The presence of Cr also promotes the precipitation of the μ phase, which can be detrimental to the desired γ' phase characteristics. Furthermore, Cr alters the elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases, influencing the formation and properties of γ' precipitates. While Cr increases the hardness of the γ' phase, this must be balanced with other properties since other aspects might be compromised (source: D:/knowledge_base/Data/1.json).\n",
      "\n",
      "The interaction between Cr and Al₂O₃ layers is also noteworthy. Cr enhances the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer by providing nucleation sites, which is particularly important in Co–Al–W-base alloys with their inherently inferior oxidation resistance. This interaction is a key factor in the design and optimization of these alloys for high-temperature applications (source: D:/knowledge_base/Data/1.json).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the addition of Cr to Co–Al–W-base alloys improves the formation of Al₂O₃ layers, enhancing oxidation resistance, but it also reduces microstructural stability and affects γ' precipitate formation. The careful optimization of Cr content is necessary to balance these effects and maintain the desired properties for high-temperature applications.\n",

Additionally, the overall oxide scale structure includes an intermediate (Co, Ni)₂(Ti, Al)O₄ spinel type oxide layer and an inner Cr₂O₃ layer, which is porous and less effective at high temperatures.

In alloy systems with a two-phase microstructure, the mole fraction of the γ' phase can be estimated using the lever rule based on the mass balance equation, which involves calculating the slope of a line from the elemental concentrations in each phase and the nominal alloy composition. This method is illustrated for alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 5Cr-B, but data for alloy 9Cr-A was not considered due to the precipitation of the μ phase.\",\n",

Additionally, increasing Cr content increases the hardness of the γ' phase, whereas increasing the Al/W ratio has the opposite effect. These changes are attributed to the elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases. Furthermore, the addition of ~30 at.% Ni is used to improve microstructural stability, although Cr addition decreases the γ' solvus temperature, which is essential for high temperature capability. Therefore, the addition of Cr must be carefully optimized to balance these properties.\",\n",

To counteract this and improve microstructural stability, ~30 at.% Ni is added to Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys, as Ni enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region, essential for high-temperature capability.

However, alloy 5Cr-B, with a high Al/W ratio, showed higher oxidation resistance and lower density, making it more suitable for engineering applications around 1000 °C. The elemental partitioning behavior, particularly the distribution of Cr which predominantly partitions to the γ phase, also plays a crucial role in determining the lattice parameters, thermodynamic stability, and mechanical behavior of these alloys. Long-term aging studies, such as those conducted for 1000 h, are essential to understand these properties in multiple-component alloy systems, as they provide insights closer to equilibrium conditions.\",\n",

In contrast, alloy 9Cr-A was not considered in the data due to the precipitation of the μ phase. The differences in oxide scale thickness and microstructure can be attributed to variations in Cr concentration and Al/W ratio, as well as the specific processing methods used, such as arc melting under argon atmosphere and solution heat treatment at 1250 °C for 24 h followed by air cooling.',\n",

This effect necessitates further exploration to understand its impact on the critical Al concentration. The significance of this relationship lies in its role in compositional optimization, as the critical Al content is also affected by Cr concentration, and increasing Cr content reduces the critical Al concentration. This interplay is crucial for achieving continuous Al₂O₃ formation, particularly at high temperatures, and requires more experimental data for definitive results.',\n",

These optimized levels contribute to improved oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. In contrast, Co–Ni-base superalloys, such as Co–Al–W-base alloys, typically contain less than 4 wt% Al and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases, indicating a need for further optimization to achieve similar oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. Additionally, nanoindentation on the γ' phase of experimental Co–Ni-base superalloys shows that γ' phase strengthening is critical for their overall mechanical properties, highlighting the importance of balanced alloy design.\",\n",
       " \"The addition of Cr in Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys influences the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at 1000°C by affecting the partitioning coefficients ($K_{γ'/γ}$) of essential γ' forming elements like Al and W. As shown in Table 6, alloys with varying Cr content exhibit different abilities to form a continuous Al₂O₃ layer; for instance, '5Cr-B' (with 5% Cr) can form the layer, while 'FC-0.0' (with 0% Cr) cannot. The discussion indicates that Cr increases $K_{γ'/γ}^{Al}$ and $K_{γ'/γ}^{Ti}$ but decreases $K_{γ'/γ}^W$. These differences must be considered in the design of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys, as Al and W are crucial for γ' formation. Compared to Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys, the elemental partitioning behaviors of Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys are more similar to Ni-base superalloys, highlighting the need for further experimental confirmation of Cr's effects on other elements.\",\n",
       " \"The typical oxide scales in the alloys 5Cr-A, 9Cr-A, and 5Cr-B after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for 100 h in air are shown in SEM-BSE images, along with their XRD results (Fig. 7). Additionally, the APT reconstructions of these alloys after water quenching for samples aged at 1000 °C for 1000 h reveal the distribution of alloying elements in the γ and γ' phases, as well as the partitioning coefficients between the γ' and γ phases (Fig. 4).\",\n",
       " \"The formation energies of different elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influence their partitioning to the γ' phase. According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., the formation energies of Co₃Al, Co₃W, Co₃Ti, Co₃Ta, Co₃Ni, and Co₃Cr with L1₂ structure are -17.97, -4.81, -25.88, -23.44, 0.50, and 2.36 kJ/mol, respectively. This suggests that Al, W, Ti, and Ta are expected to partition to the γ' phase, whereas Ni and Cr are not. However, this is an idealistic analysis and may vary in different cases. Regarding Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys, experimental data from literature and studies show the ability to form continuous Al₂O₃ layers after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C in air. For instance, an alloy with 10 at.% Cr and 9.5 at.% Al demonstrated the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer, as depicted in Fig. 11. This data highlights the impact of varying Cr and Al concentrations on the oxidation behavior of these alloys.\",\n",
       " \"The formation energies of elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys significantly influence their partitioning to the γ' phase. According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., elements like Al, W, Ti, and Ta, which have negative formation energies (-17.97, -4.81, -25.88, and -23.44 kJ/mol respectively), are expected to partition to the γ' phase. In contrast, Ni and Cr, with positive or near-zero formation energies (0.50 and 2.36 kJ/mol respectively), do not favor this partitioning. This partitioning behavior suggests that Al and Cr contents in Co–Al–W-base alloys need to be carefully optimized. While Al can improve oxidation resistance by forming a passive layer and has synergistic effects with Cr, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases. Therefore, further optimization of Al and Cr contents is necessary to enhance both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability in these alloys.\",\n",
       " \"The addition of 30 at.% Ni in Co-Ni-base alloys enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, increasing the solubility of Al in these phases. This is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. The external oxide scales of these alloys consist of CoO, Co₂TiO₄, and Cr₂O₃ layers, while internal Al₂O₃ forms in alloys with low Al content (9 at.%). High Al content (11 at.%) suppresses internal oxidation, forming a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This understanding is beneficial for designing Co-Ni-base multiple-component alloys that balance microstructural stability, oxidation properties, mechanical properties, and lower density, and aids in understanding partitioning behavior after long-term aging and oxidation mechanisms at elevated temperatures, such as 1000 °C.\",\n",
       " \"Co–Ni-base superalloys benefit from γ' phase strengthening, which is critical for their overall mechanical properties, as indicated by nanoindentation studies. In contrast, conventional Co-base superalloys lack a stable γ' strengthening phase, limiting their high-temperature applications despite having higher melting temperatures, better fatigue resistance, and weldability compared to Ni-base superalloys. The development of γ' precipitation in Co-Al-W alloys and other γ' strengthened Co-base alloys has opened new paths for enhancing their performance.\",\n",
       " \"The mass gain curves of experimental Co–Ni-base superalloys, such as 5Cr-A, 9Cr-A, and 5Cr-B, show varying mass gains after isothermal oxidation at 1000 °C for 100 hours. For instance, 5Cr-A had a mass gain of 7.06 mg/cm², 9Cr-A had 2.01 mg/cm², and 5Cr-B had 0.99 mg/cm². These values are compared with other Co–Al–W-base alloys and commercial Ni-base superalloys, as depicted in Fig. 6 of the study titled 'Effects of Cr and Al/W ratio on the microstructural stability, oxidation property and γ' phase nano-hardness of multi-component Co–Ni-base superalloys'. The comparison highlights the performance differences in oxidation resistance among these alloy types.\"]"

      "Long-term aging has a significant effect on the microstructure of alloys. In the context provided, the following effects are observed:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Microstructural Stability**: Increasing the Cr content in alloys can significantly reduce the microstructural stability and promote the precipitation of μ phase. This indicates that the presence of Cr can lead to changes in the alloy's microstructure over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Phase Formation**: The higher Cr content in alloy 9Cr-A resulted in the precipitation of μ phase, which was identified by XRD and EPMA. This phase was not present in the 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B alloys, suggesting that the Cr content plays a role in phase formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **γ' Phase**: The γ' precipitates coarsened with longer aging time in all alloys. After aging at 1100 °C for 300 h, the γ' volume fractions of alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 5Cr-B were reduced, while the γ' phase of alloy 9Cr-A was almost dissolved. This shows that aging time can affect the size and stability of γ' precipitates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **γ' Volume Fraction**: The γ' volume fraction varied with the aging time and the Cr content. For example, after aging at 1000 °C for 300 h, the γ' volume fraction of alloy 5Cr-A was 80.4%, but it decreased to 53.4% after aging at 1100 °C for 300 h. The higher Cr content in alloy 9Cr-A reduced the γ' volume fraction to 64.6%, while the higher Al/W ratio in alloy 5Cr-B led to a higher γ' volume fraction of 89.9%.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hardness**: Increasing the Cr content increases the hardness of the γ' phase, while increasing the Al/W ratio shows the opposite effect, indicating that aging can also affect the mechanical properties of the alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, long-term aging can lead to changes in phase composition, precipitation behavior, and mechanical properties of alloys, which are influenced by factors such as the aging temperature, the composition of the alloy, and the duration of aging. \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Elemental Partitioning Behaviors:**\n",
      "   - The APT (Atom Probe Tomography) results indicate that elements like Ni, Al, Ta, and Ti tend to partition to the γ' phase, while Co and Cr have a preference for the γ phase. This partitioning affects the microstructure and properties of the alloy.\n",
      "   - The order of elemental partitioning coefficients shows that Ta has the highest affinity for the γ' phase, followed by Ti, Al, Ni, and W, with Co and Cr having lower affinities. This order influences the distribution of elements within the alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Increase in Cr Content:**\n",
      "   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase.\n",
      "   - It increases the hardness of the γ' phase, which is beneficial for enhancing the alloy's mechanical properties.\n",
      "   - However, it also reduces the microstructural stability, which could potentially affect the alloy's performance under certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increase in Al/W Ratio:**\n",
      "   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction, which can improve the alloy's oxidation resistance.\n",
      "   - It also increases the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can affect the alloy's mechanical behavior.\n",
      "   - The increase in Al/W ratio can soften the γ' phase, which might have implications for the alloy's hardness and strength.\n",

      "**Implications for Industrial Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- The well-balanced combination of microstructural stability, alloy density, γ' phase hardness, and oxidation resistance achieved through these modifications can lead to the development of high-performance Co–Ni-base superalloys.\n",
      "- The improved oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys like Waspaloy and Udimet 720, suggests that these alloys could be suitable for applications where resistance to high-temperature oxidation is critical.\n",
      "- The ability to achieve a balance of properties is crucial for industrial applications, as it ensures that the alloys can maintain their structural integrity and performance under the demanding conditions they are subjected to.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Development and Research**: Co-Al-W alloys with γ' precipitation were first identified in 1971 and have been systematically studied since 2006, opening up a new path for the development of Co-base superalloys. In contrast, Ni-base superalloys have been more extensively researched and developed.\n",

      "6. **Oxidation Resistance**: While the creep properties of Co-Al-W-base single crystal alloys can be comparable to those of commercial Ni-base single crystal superalloys, the oxidation resistance at high temperatures is also essential for engineering applications, and this is an area where Ni-base superalloys have traditionally been more studied.\n",

      "1. **Formation of Continuous Al₂O₃ Layer**: The study indicates that a continuous Al₂O₃ layer forms only when the Al concentration is higher than a critical value in the Ni–Cr–Al or Co–Cr–Al alloy systems. The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is because the presence of Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, which in turn increases the solubility of Al in the γ/γ' two-phase region. This enhanced solubility of Al is crucial for the formation of the protective oxide layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Synergistic Effect with Cr**: The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. The transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, even lower concentrations of Al can lead to the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Oxide Scale Structure**: The presence of 30 at.% Ni contributes to the overall structure of the oxide scale. It helps in maintaining the microstructural stability, which is essential for the integrity of the oxide scale. The combination of Ni and Cr in the alloy system is optimized to promote the formation of a protective oxide layer that is continuous and stable, thus enhancing the alloy's resistance to oxidation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system is crucial for achieving a continuous Al₂O₃ layer by increasing Al solubility and enhancing the synergistic effect with Cr, which together contribute to the microstructural stability and overall oxide scale structure. \n",

However, the γ/γ' two-phase region of Co–Al–W-base alloys is very narrow, and adding Cr can promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to mechanical properties.\n",

      "3. **Role of 30 at.% Ni**: The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance.

      "   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can also affect the microstructural stability. The γ' phase is a strengthening phase in superalloys, but changes in its volume fraction and lattice misfit can impact the overall stability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **High Temperature Capability**:\n",
      "   - The addition of Cr decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys. This is a concern for the high temperature capability of superalloys, as a lower solvus temperature can limit their ability to maintain structural integrity at elevated temperatures.\n",

      "3. **Oxide Layer Formation**:\n",
      "   - The experimental results indicate that increasing both the Cr content and the Al/W ratio predominantly enhance the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C. This suggests that the formation of an oxide layer on the surface of the alloy is improved with these changes, which is beneficial for maintaining high temperature capability and structural integrity.\n",

      "The addition of Cr in Co–Al–W-base alloys has a significant influence on the formation of Al₂O₃ layers and the microstructural stability:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Formation of Al₂O₃ Layers:\n",
      "   - The addition of Cr has a remarkable synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers. This is because the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, which reduces the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer [28].\n",
      "   - This synergistic effect is illustrated in Fig. 11, which plots an oxide map of the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system at 1000 °C, showing the ability for forming continuous Al₂O₃ layers of different alloys.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Microstructural Stability:\n",
      "   - The addition of Cr promotes significant precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are deleterious for mechanical properties [21,22].\n",
      "   - To alleviate this problem, most Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys utilize ~30 at.% Ni additions to improve their microstructural stability [14,17,23–26]. The Ni addition is effective because it has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region [27].\n",
      "   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase [abstract].\n",
      "   - The addition of Cr also decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys, which is essential for the high-temperature capability of superalloys [content].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while Cr enhances the formation of Al₂O₃ layers through its synergistic effect with Al, it also destabilizes the microstructure, particularly by promoting the precipitation of brittle secondary phases and reducing the γ' solvus temperature. This necessitates careful optimization of Cr content, often in conjunction with Ni additions, to balance oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. \n",

      "Temperature effects and alloy composition significantly influence the performance and suitability of 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B superalloys for engineering applications, particularly in terms of creep resistance and oxidation properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Temperature Effects:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Creep Resistance:** At higher temperatures, such as 1100 °C, the δ phase in alloy 5Cr-B distinctly reduces, which is deduced by the spherical γ' morphology. This reduction in δ phase may affect the coherent strengthening effect of the γ' phase, which is predominantly associated with the magnitude of δ. Despite this, alloy 5Cr-A may exhibit better creep resistance than alloy 5Cr-B at 1100 °C due to a higher magnitude of δ, assuming their γ' volume fractions are similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oxidation Properties:** At 1000 °C, the oxidation resistance of alloys can be influenced by the formation of protective oxide layers. The Cr content in the alloys plays a role in the nucleation and growth of Cr₂O₃ layers, which can reduce the growth rate of external oxides like CoO. However, above 900 °C, Cr₂O₃ layers can become porous, which may not provide adequate oxidation protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Alloy Composition:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Creep Resistance:** The Al/W ratio in alloy 5Cr-B is higher than in alloy 5Cr-A, which increases the γ' volume fraction. A higher γ' volume fraction is appreciated for better mechanical properties, such as creep resistance. Both alloys show promise for good creep resistance at high temperatures, with γ' volume fractions above 80% after aging at 1000 °C for 1000 h.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oxidation Properties:** The higher Al concentration in alloy 5Cr-B allows for the formation of a dense continuous Al₂O₃ layer, which provides effective oxidation protection even at 1000 °C. This results in superior oxidation resistance for alloy 5Cr-B compared to alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 9Cr-A, which exhibit inferior oxidation resistance due to the formation of discrete internal oxide Al₂O₃ and porous Cr₂O₃ layers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suitability for Engineering Applications:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Alloy 5Cr-B:** Due to its higher oxidation resistance and the potential for better creep resistance at high temperatures, alloy 5Cr-B may be more suitable for engineering applications over alloy 5Cr-A at around 1000 °C.\n",
      "- **Alloy 5Cr-A:** While it may have better creep resistance at 1100 °C, its inferior oxidation properties compared to alloy 5Cr-B may limit its suitability for certain high-temperature engineering applications.\n",
      "\n",

      "The elemental partitioning behaviors of Cr and the Al/W ratio influence the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance in Co-base superalloys in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Cr Content:**\n",
      "   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability.\n",
      "   - It promotes the precipitation of μ phase, which is a deleterious phase.\n",
      "   - It increases the hardness of the γ' phase, which is beneficial for the alloy's mechanical properties.\n",
      "   - The APT (atom probe tomography) results suggest that these effects are mainly attributed to the change in elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Al/W Ratio:**\n",
      "   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can affect the microstructure.\n",
      "   - It enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, which is beneficial for the alloy's performance at high temperatures.\n",

      "In summary, the Cr content and the Al/W ratio have complex effects on the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. While increasing Cr content can improve oxidation resistance and γ' phase hardness, it may also reduce microstructural stability and promote the precipitation of μ phase. Conversely, increasing the Al/W ratio can enhance oxidation resistance and γ' phase volume fraction but may soften the γ' phase. The balance between these effects is crucial for achieving a superalloy with optimal properties for industrial applications. \n",

      "The Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys, such as the widely used 2nd Ni-base single crystal superalloy CMSX-4, are highly optimized. For CMSX-4, the Al content is 5.6 wt% (12.6 at.%), and the Cr content is 6.5 wt% (7.6 at.%). In contrast, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al (~10 at.%) and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases.\n",

      "1. **Mechanical Properties**: The optimized Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys contribute to their superior mechanical properties. The synergistic effects of Al and Cr in forming protective oxidation layers can enhance the oxidation resistance and contribute to the overall strength and stability of the alloy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The higher Al and Cr contents in Ni-base superalloys, such as CMSX-4, are likely to provide better oxidation resistance due to the formation of a passive layer that protects the metal from further oxidation. This is important for applications where the alloy is exposed to high-temperature environments.\n",

      "In Co–Ni-base superalloys, the lower Al and Cr contents are chosen to avoid deleterious phases and to optimize the microstructure for oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. The study mentioned indicates that increasing the Cr content in Co–Ni-base alloys can enhance oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, but it also reduces microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase. Similarly, increasing the Al/W ratio can increase the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can affect the hardness of the γ' phase.\n",

      "Overall, the balance of Al and Cr contents in both types of superalloys is crucial for achieving the desired combination of mechanical properties and oxidation resistance. The lower Al and Cr contents in Co–Ni-base alloys suggest a focus on optimizing for specific applications where the microstructural stability and oxidation resistance at high temperatures are critical, while the higher contents in Ni-base superalloys may be aimed at providing broader performance capabilities. \n",

      "The addition of Cr in Co–Ni–Al–W–Cr-base alloys has a significant influence on the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer at 1000°C. The presence of Cr enhances the synergistic effect with Al, which accelerates the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. Specifically, the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, thereby reducing the critical Al concentration value required for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, less Al is needed to achieve a continuous oxide layer, which is beneficial for the alloy design.\n",

      "4. **γ/γ' Two-Phase Region**: The addition of Cr can affect the γ/γ' two-phase region of the alloy, potentially altering the microstructure and properties. The effects on the γ/γ' two-phase region need to be carefully managed to maintain the desired microstructural stability.\n",

      "The formation energies of various elements in Co–Al–W-base alloys influence their partitioning to the γ' phase in the following way:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Formation Energy**: The magnitude of $K_{γ'/γ}^X$ in Co–Al–W-base alloys is determined by the formation energy of the L1₂ structured Co₃X phase. The more negative the formation energy, the larger the magnitude of $K_{γ'/γ}^X$.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Element Partitioning**: According to the first-principles study by Omori et al., the formation energies of various Co₃X phases with L1₂ structure are as follows:\n",
      "   - Co₃Al: -17.97 kJ/mol\n",
      "   - Co₃W: -4.81 kJ/mol\n",
      "   - Co₃Ti: -25.88 kJ/mol\n",
      "   - Co₃Ta: -23.44 kJ/mol\n",
      "   - Co₃Ni: 0.50 kJ/mol\n",
      "   - Co₃Cr: 2.36 kJ/mol\n",
      "\n",
      "   This suggests that Al, W, Ti, and Ta are expected to partition to the γ' phase in Co–Al–W-base alloys, as they have more negative formation energies compared to Ni and Cr. In contrast, Ni and Cr are less likely to partition to the γ' phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implications for Optimization**:\n",
      "   - **Oxidation Resistance**: Since Al and Cr are less likely to partition to the γ' phase, optimizing their contents in the alloy can be challenging. However, their presence is crucial for oxidation resistance. Al forms a passive layer that improves oxidation resistance, and Cr promotes the formation of a protective oxide layer (Cr₂O₃).\n",
      "   - **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of Cr improves oxidation resistance but can promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to mechanical properties. To mitigate this, alloys often include Ni additions to expand the γ/γ' two-phase region and improve microstructural stability.\n",
      "   - **Al and Cr Contents**: To optimize the Al and Cr contents for improved oxidation resistance without significantly reducing microstructural stability, it is important to balance their concentrations. This may involve finding the right amount of Al and Cr that can form protective layers while also considering the effects of other elements like Ni, which can stabilize the microstructure.\n",
      "\n",

      "The addition of 30 at.% Ni in Co-Ni-base alloys has several implications for microstructural stability and oxidation resistance:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is because Ni has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region in these alloys. The γ/γ' two-phase region refers to the region in the alloy's phase diagram where both γ (the face-centered cubic phase) and γ' (the ordered face-centered cubic phase) phases can coexist. By increasing the size of this region, Ni helps to maintain a stable microstructure, which is important for the alloy's mechanical properties and resistance to phase transformations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The study by Weiser et al. indicates that Al₂O₃ starts to nucleate in the γ channel, meaning that Al atoms are exclusively provided by the γ channel during the initial stages of internal scale formation. A high concentration of Al in the γ phase (C^Al_{γ}) is crucial for the formation of an adequate Al₂O₃ layer, which is a protective oxide layer that helps to resist oxidation. Increasing the Al/W ratio in the alloys results in a higher C^Al_{γ}, which is beneficial for the nucleation and stability of Al₂O₃. The addition of 30 at.% Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, which increases the solubility of Al in the γ/γ' two-phase region, thus enhancing the formation of the protective Al₂O₃ layer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implications for alloy design include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Optimization of Composition**: Designers should consider the addition of 30 at.% Ni to improve both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is particularly important for alloys intended for high-temperature applications where oxidation resistance is critical.\n",
      "- **Balancing Properties**: Achieving a balance between microstructural stability, oxidation resistance, and other properties such as density and hardness is essential. The addition of Ni helps to achieve this balance by influencing the phase composition and the formation of protective oxide layers.\n",
      "- **Enhanced Performance**: The improved oxidation resistance and microstructural stability can lead to enhanced performance of the alloy, making it suitable for applications where these properties are critical, such as in superalloys for high-temperature turbines and other aerospace components. \n",

The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance.

This enhanced solubility of Al is crucial for the formation of the protective oxide layer.\\n\\n2. **Synergistic Effect with Cr**: The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. The transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, even lower concentrations of Al can lead to the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer.\\n\\n3. **Oxide Scale Structure**: The presence of 30 at.% Ni contributes to the overall structure of the oxide scale.

Therefore, many studies have investigated the elemental partitioning between phases in Co-Al-W-base alloys as part of the development of these new materials [22,24,27,35,42-45]. However, most of these researches have focused on quaternary alloy systems [22,27,35,42-44], often aged for short-term [24,27,35,42-45], such as 40-200 h. Thus, research on the elemental partitioning behavior after long-term aging (closer to equilibrium), such as 1000 h, is still limited [22], especially in multiple-component alloy systems.\"}',\n",

On the other hand, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al (~10 at.%) [29], and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases.

The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. This is because the presence of Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side, which in turn increases the solubility of Al in the γ/γ' two-phase region. This enhanced solubility of Al is crucial for the formation of the protective oxide layer.\\n\\n2. **Synergistic Effect with Cr**: The addition of Cr has a synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of the Al₂O₃ layer. The transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, reducing the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer. This means that with the addition of Cr, even lower concentrations of Al can lead to the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer.\\n\\n3. **Oxide Scale Structure**: The presence of 30 at.% Ni contributes to the overall structure of the oxide scale. It helps in maintaining the microstructural stability, which is essential for the integrity of the oxide scale. The combination of Ni and Cr in the alloy system is optimized to promote the formation of a protective oxide layer that is continuous and stable, thus enhancing the alloy's resistance to oxidation.\\n\\nIn summary, the addition of 30 at.% Ni in the Ni–Cr–Al alloy system is crucial for achieving a continuous Al₂O₃ layer by increasing Al solubility and enhancing the synergistic effect with Cr, which together contribute to the microstructural stability and overall oxide scale structure.\",\n",

Al forms a passive layer that improves oxidation resistance, and it typically has synergistic effects with Cr in the formation of protective oxidation layers. This is because the presence of Al can enhance the stability and growth of the Al₂O₃ layer, which is beneficial for oxidation resistance.\\n\\n2. **Microstructural Stability**: The addition of Cr to Co–Al–W-base alloys improves oxidation resistance by promoting the formation of a protective oxide layer, Cr₂O₃. However, the γ/γ' two-phase region of Co–Al–W-base alloys is very narrow, and adding Cr can promote the precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are detrimental to mechanical properties.\\n\\n3. **Role of 30 at.% Ni**: The addition of 30 at.% Ni is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance. Ni has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region, which helps to mitigate the precipitation of brittle secondary phases that Cr can promote. This is particularly important in the Co–Al–W-base alloy system, where the γ/γ' two-phase region is narrow.\\n\\n4. **Optimization of Al and Cr Contents**: The contents of Al and Cr in Co–Al–W-base alloys need to be optimized for both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability. The synergistic effects of Al and Cr have been rarely considered and discussed in previous studies, but they are important for achieving the desired properties.\\n\\nIn summary, the synergistic effect of Al and Cr in the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system is beneficial for both oxidation resistance and microstructural stability.

This method is particularly useful for estimating the mole fraction of γ' phase in alloys like 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B.\\n\\n- For alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 5Cr-B, the mole fraction of the γ' phase can be estimated by the slope of a line following the equation: $(C^X_{alloy} - C^X_γ) = f_{γ'} (C^X_{γ'} - C^X_γ)$, where $f_{γ'}$ is the mole fractions of the γ' phase (the slope), and $C^X_{alloy}$ is the nominal concentration of element X in the alloys.\\n\\n- The two-phase microstructure, which consists of γ and γ' phases in alloys like 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B, allows for the use of the lever rule to calculate the mole fraction of the γ' phase.

These protective layers are a result of oxidation processes and can be influenced by the microstructure of the alloy.\\n\\n2. **Stability of Oxide Layers**: The stability of these oxide layers at high temperatures is crucial. For instance, Cr₂O₃ is not stable above 900 °C and is further oxidized to gaseous CrO₃. This suggests that the microstructure, particularly the presence and stability of these oxides, can change with temperature and affect oxidation resistance.\\n\\n3. **Synergistic Effects**: The context mentions that elements like Cr, Al, and Si have synergistic effects on each other, which can influence the microstructure and, consequently, the oxidation resistance of the alloy.\\n\\n4. **Embrittlement**: The addition of Si can embrittle alloys, which would affect the microstructure and potentially the alloy's ability to resist oxidation.\\n\\n5. **Cr Content and Al/W Ratio**: Increasing the Cr content or the Al/W ratio can enhance oxidation resistance, as seen in the case of alloy 5Cr-A and 5Cr-B.

       " \"The variations in Cr and Al concentrations in Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloys affect their microstructural stability and high temperature capability in several ways, as evidenced by the experimental studies:\\n\\n1. **Microstructural Stability**:\\n   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability of the alloys. This is because higher Cr content promotes the precipitation of μ phase, which can lead to a less stable microstructure.\\n   - Increasing the Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit, which can also affect the microstructural stability. The γ' phase is a strengthening phase in superalloys, but changes in its volume fraction and lattice misfit can impact the overall stability.\\n\\n2. **High Temperature Capability**:\\n   - The addition of Cr decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys. This is a concern for the high temperature capability of superalloys, as a lower solvus temperature can limit their ability to maintain structural integrity at elevated temperatures.\\n   - The balance between Cr and Al content is crucial for maintaining the high temperature capability. While increasing Cr content can enhance oxidation resistance, it can also negatively impact the high temperature performance due to the decrease in γ' solvus temperature.\\n\\n3. **Oxide Layer Formation**:\\n   - The experimental results indicate that increasing both the Cr content and the Al/W ratio predominantly enhance the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C.

Formation of Al₂O₃ Layers:\\n   - The addition of Cr has a remarkable synergistic effect with Al for accelerating the formation of Al₂O₃ layers. This is because the transient Cr₂O₃ provides nucleation sites for Al₂O₃, which reduces the critical Al concentration value needed for the formation of a continuous Al₂O₃ layer [28].\\n   - This synergistic effect is illustrated in Fig. 11, which plots an oxide map of the Co–Ni–Al–W-base alloy system at 1000 °C, showing the ability for forming continuous Al₂O₃ layers of different alloys.\\n\\n2. Microstructural Stability:\\n   - The addition of Cr promotes significant precipitation of brittle secondary phases, which are deleterious for mechanical properties [21,22].\\n   - To alleviate this problem, most Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys utilize ~30 at.% Ni additions to improve their microstructural stability [14,17,23–26]. The Ni addition is effective because it has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region [27].\\n   - Increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase [abstract].\\n   - The addition of Cr also decreases the γ' solvus temperature of Co–Al–W-base alloys, which is essential for the high-temperature capability of superalloys [content].\\n\\nIn summary, while Cr enhances the formation of Al₂O₃ layers through its synergistic effect with Al, it also destabilizes the microstructure, particularly by promoting the precipitation of brittle secondary phases and reducing the γ' solvus temperature. This necessitates careful optimization of Cr content, often in conjunction with Ni additions, to balance oxidation resistance and microstructural stability.\",\n",

This reduction in δ phase may affect the coherent strengthening effect of the γ' phase, which is predominantly associated with the magnitude of δ.

The γ/γ' two-phase region refers to the region in the alloy's phase diagram where both γ (the face-centered cubic phase) and γ' (the ordered face-centered cubic phase) phases can coexist. By increasing the size of this region, Ni helps to maintain a stable microstructure, which is important for the alloy's mechanical properties and resistance to phase transformations.\\n\\n2. **Oxidation Resistance**: The study by Weiser et al. indicates that Al₂O₃ starts to nucleate in the γ channel, meaning that Al atoms are exclusively provided by the γ channel during the initial stages of internal scale formation. A high concentration of Al in the γ phase (C^Al_{γ}) is crucial for the formation of an adequate Al₂O₃ layer, which is a protective oxide layer that helps to resist oxidation. Increasing the Al/W ratio in the alloys results in a higher C^Al_{γ}, which is beneficial for the nucleation and stability of Al₂O₃.

Furthermore, increasing the Cr content and Al/W ratio predominantly enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, resulting in promising oxidation property which is comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys Waspaloy and Udimet 720. Finally, the well balance of the microstructural stability, alloy density, γ\\' phase hardness and oxidation resistance can be achieved. This study will be beneficial for the continuous efforts on the development of multi-component Co–Ni-base superalloys for industrial applications.\"}',\n",

The following specific conclusions can be drawn based on the present study: 1. Increasing Cr content improves the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C and the hardness of the γ\\' phase; however, it reduces the Tγ\\'-solvus and promotes the precipitation of deleterious μ phase. 2.

The morphology of γ\\' phase changed from nearly cuboidal to near spherical via increasing the Cr content (Fig. 2(a1) and (b1)) as a result of the reduction of the δ, as analyzed in 4.2. This phenomenon is also in consistent due to the study by Povstugar at el.
