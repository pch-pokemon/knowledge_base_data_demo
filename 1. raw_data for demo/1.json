The microstructural stabilities were investigated at 1000 °C and 1100 °C after long-term aging. The experimental results indicate that increasing the Cr content significantly reduces the microstructural stability and promotes the precipitation of μ phase; while increasing Al/W ratio increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit. At the same time, increasing the Cr content increases the hardness of γ' phase and increasing Al/W ratio shows the opposite effect. The APT results reveal that such effects should be mainly attributed to the change of elemental partitioning behaviors between the γ and γ' phases. Furthermore, increasing the Cr content and Al/W ratio predominantly enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C, resulting in promising oxidation property which is comparable to commercial Ni-base superalloys Waspaloy and Udimet 720.

Co-Al-W alloys with γ' precipitation were first identified in 1971 by Lee [2], and were subsequently rediscovered and systematic studied in 2006 by Sato et al. [3], opening up a new path for further development of Co-base superalloys.

However, as the γ/γ' two-phase region of Co–Al–W-base alloys is very narrow [3], the addition of Cr also promotes significant precipitation of brittle secondary phases [21,22], which are deleterious for mechanical properties. To alleviate this problem, most of the reported Cr-containing Co–Al–W-base alloys utilize ~30 at.% Ni additions to improve their microstructural stability [14,17,23–26], as Ni has been shown to enlarge the γ/γ' two-phase region [27]."

On the other hand, the majority of reported Co–Al–W-base alloys contain less than 4 wt% of Al (~10 at.%) [29], and low Cr content to avoid deleterious phases.

In order to promote the engineering application of this alloy, it is necessary to further improve the γ' solvus temperature, microstructural stability and oxidation resistance, as well as reduce the alloy density. Our previous work indicated that the Al/W ratio is an essential parameter for Co–Ni-base alloys.

In this study, similar anti-sites for Cr atoms can be deduced by the composition of the γ' phase (Table 4). In alloy 5Cr-A and alloy 9Cr-A, the sum content of Co and Ni in γ' phase were 73.8 at.% and 72.7 at.%, respectively, indicating that some anti-site solute atoms in the A site are needed and are increased with increasing Cr content.

Therefore, the solubility of W in the γ matrix is significantly reduced with increasing the Cr content. This is because Cr and W have a similar partition preference, and the strong enrichment of Cr in the γ phase (Fig. 4, Table 4) reduces the solid solubility of W in the γ matrix.

The morphology of γ' phase changed from nearly cuboidal to near spherical via increasing the Cr content (Fig. 2(a1) and (b1)) as a result of the reduction of the δ, as analyzed in 4.2. This phenomenon is also in consistent due to the study by Povstugar at el.

Therefore, increasing the solubility of Al in both γ and γ' phases is necessary for the formation of the protective oxide. Our previous studies revealed that the addition of 30 at.% Ni significantly enlarges the γ/γ' two-phase region towards the Al-rich side [30], resulting in an increase of Al solubility in the γ/γ' two-phase region. Therefore, the addition of 30 at.% Ni in the present alloys is necessary for both microstructural stability and oxidation resistance."

[58] points out that Al₂O₃ starts to nucleate in the γ channel, i.e., the Al atoms are exclusively provided by the γ channel during the first hours after the initiation of internal scale formation. This finding indicates that a high C^Al_{γ} can be a key for the formation of an adequate Al₂O₃ layer. In the present alloys, increasing the Al/W ratio resulted in a higher C^Al_{γ} (Table 4), which is beneficial for the nucleation and stability of Al₂O₃, and further transition to a continuous layer during the early stage of oxidation."

Increasing Cr content improves the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C and the hardness of the γ' phase; however, it reduces the Tγ'-solvus and promotes the precipitation of deleterious μ phase. 2. Increasing Al/W ratio not only predominantly enhances the oxidation resistance at 1000 °C and reduces the alloy density, but also increases the γ' volume fraction and the γ/γ' lattice misfit; however, it slightly softens the γ' phase. 3."
